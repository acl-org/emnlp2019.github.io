There is a new initiative "Diversity &amp; Inclusion" designed to help the ACL community make our conferences more accessible and inclusive to everyone. Three main axes are addressed through sponsorship:

<ul>
<li><b>Parental inclusion and childcare.</b>ACL wants to become more family-friendly and inclusive of researchers who would have difficulty in attending the conference without some additional support.</li>
<li><b>Disability access.</b> The physical environment of ACL conferences should encourage all attendees. Therefore, the ACL would like to extend special support to participants whose access to integral parts of the conference would be compromised due to poor disability access.</li>
<li><b>Low-income support:</b> Students and researchers at institutions with access to fewer resources are often prevented from attending ACL conferences. ACL would like to offer financial support to help as many of them as possible to attend the conference in person.</li>
</ul>

We gratefully acknowledge support for the initiative provided by the following sponsors for EMNLP-IJCNLP 2019. 

Further sponsors to be announced.
