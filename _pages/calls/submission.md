Both abstract submissions and full paper submissions are to be made through the START system at [https://www.softconf.com/emnlp2019/papers/](https://www.softconf.com/emnlp2019/papers/).


## Abstract submissions

For all submissions, abstracts must be submitted by May 15, 2019, Pacific Daylight Savings Time (UTC -7h). No new submissions can be made after this deadline.

It is mandatory to submit the abstract of the paper. The abstract can still be modified after the abstract submission deadline, but no substantial changes should be made, i.e., the modified abstract should stay faithful to the original version.

It is mandatory to choose the Subject Area of the paper, and this cannot be changed after the abstract submission deadline.

It is optional to submit the full paper as part of the abstract submission.


## Full paper submissions

Full paper submissions are due by May 21, 2019, Pacific Daylight Savings Time (UTC - 7h).

The list of authors cannot be changed after the full paper submission deadline, i.e., the list of authors cannot be changed for accepted papers during camera-ready submission.


## Questions and answers on submissions

<b>Q:</b> Is there a separate abstract submission page?<br>
<b>A:</b> No. Both abstract submission and paper submission are done through the [START](https://www.softconf.com/emnlp2019/papers/) system. Before the abstract submission deadline, submission of the paper (in PDF format) is optional. After the abstract submission deadline, submission of the paper (in PDF format) is mandatory.

<b>Q:</b> Can the abstract be changed after the abstract submission deadline?
<b>A:</b> Yes, the abstract can still be modified after the abstract submission deadline, but no substantial changes should be made, i.e., the modified abstract should stay faithful to the original version.

<b>Q:</b> What if my paper is relevant to multiple Subject Areas?
<b>A:</b> Your paper will be handled within a single area. Therefore, we suggest that you choose the area that your paper is most relevant to during submission. The Senior Area Chairs will try their best to assign your paper to the right reviewers.
