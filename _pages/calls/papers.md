[SIGDAT](http://sigdat.org), the Association for Computational Linguistics (ACL) special interest group on linguistic data and corpus-based approaches to NLP, and the [AFNLP](http://www.afnlp.org), the Asian Federation of Natural Language Processing, invite you to submit your papers to EMNLP-IJCNLP 2019, the 2019 Conference on Empirical Methods in Natural Language Processing and the 9th International Joint Conference on Natural Language Processing (November 3&ndash;7, 2019) in Hong Kong.

We invite the submission of long and short papers related to empirical methods in natural language processing. Accepted papers will be presented as oral talks or posters. As in recent years, the conference will also include presentations of selected papers accepted by the [Transactions of the Association for Computational Linguistics (TACL)](http://www.transacl.org).

## Abstracts and Paper Submission Information

We will be accepting submissions online via [START](https://www.softconf.com/emnlp2019/papers/). The abstract submission deadline for both long and short papers is May 15, 2019, and the paper submission deadline for long and short papers is May 21, 2019.

EMNLP-IJCNLP 2019 uses a double-blind review process. Each submission will be reviewed by at least three program committee members. 


### Long papers

EMNLP-IJCNLP 2019 long paper submissions must describe substantial, original, completed and unpublished work. Wherever appropriate, concrete evaluation and analysis should be included. Each submission will be reviewed by at least three program committee members. Each long paper submission consists of a paper of up to eight (8) pages of content, plus unlimited pages for references; final versions of long papers will be given one additional page (up to nine pages with unlimited pages for references) so that reviewers' comments can be taken into account.


### Short papers

EMNLP-IJCNLP 2019 also solicits short papers. Short paper submissions must describe original and unpublished work. While a short paper is not a shortened long paper, the characteristics of short papers include: a small, focused contribution; work in progress; a negative result; an opinion piece; an interesting application nugget. Each short paper submission consists of up to four (4) pages of content, plus unlimited pages for references; final versions of short papers will be given one additional page (up to five pages in the proceedings and unlimited pages for references) so that reviewers' comments can be taken into account. Each short paper submission will be reviewed by at least three program committee members.


### IMPORTANT: Anonymity Period

EMNLP-IJCNLP 2019 adopts ACL's [new policies for submission, review, and citation](https://www.aclweb.org/portal/content/new-policies-submission-review-and-citation). Submissions that violate any of these policies will be rejected without review. 

Most importantly, the policies define an anonymity period, which starts on April 21, 2019 (11:59pm PDT).

- You may not make a non-anonymized version of your paper available to the general community (for example, by posting it on your home page or submitting it to arXiv) during the anonymity period. However, you may take such an action before the anonymity period begins, even if the paper actually becomes public after the anonymity period begins (for example, because arXiv makes papers public one or two days after receiving them).

- You may not update a non-anonymized version during the anonymity period, and we ask you not to advertise it on social media or take other actions that would further compromise double-blind reviewing during the anonymity period.

- You may make an anonymized version of your paper available, even during the anonymity period (for example, on  [OpenReview](https://openreview.net/group?id=OpenReview.net/Anonymous_Preprint)).

- During the anonymity period, you may not update a non-anonymized version, advertise an anonymized or non-anonymized version on social media, or take any other action that would compromise double-blind reviewing during the anonymity period.

For the background of the new policies, refer to the [online version](https://www.aclweb.org/portal/content/new-policies-submission-review-and-citation).


### Instructions for Double-Blind Review

To ensure anonymity, submissions and supplementary materials must not include the authors' names and affiliations. Furthermore, self-references that reveal the author's identity, e.g., "We previously showed (Smith, 1991) ...", should be avoided. Instead, use citations such as "Smith (1991) previously showed ...". Acknowledgments of funding or assistance must also be omitted. Submissions should not contain pointers to supplemental information on the web; any such material should be submitted as supplementary materials (see above). Submissions that do not conform to these requirements will be rejected without review. Separate author identification information is required as part of the online submission process.


### Multiple Submission Policy

<span style="color:cornflowerblue">EMNLP-IJCNLP 2019 will not consider any paper that is under review in a journal or another conference at the time of submission.</span> Neither will the conference consider any paper that overlaps significantly in content or results with papers that will be (or have been) published elsewhere. In addition, <span style="color:cornflowerblue">authors may not submit the paper elsewhere during EMNLP-IJCNLP 2019's review period.</span> Authors submitting more than one paper to EMNLP-IJCNLP 2019 must ensure that the submissions do not overlap significantly (>25%) with each other in content or results.


### Formatting Requirements

Both long and short papers must follow the EMNLP-IJCNLP 2019 two-column format. Please do not modify these style files, or use templates designed for other conferences. Submissions that do not conform to the required styles, including paper size, margin width, and font size restrictions, will be rejected without review.

All submitted papers must follow the EMNLP-IJCNLP 2019 two-column format, using the [LaTeX style files](http://bit.ly/emnlp-ijcnlp2019-latex), the [Word template](http://bit.ly/emnlp-ijcnlp2019-word), or the [Overleaf template](http://bit.ly/emnlp-ijcnlp2019-overleaf). Please neither modify these style files, nor use templates designed for other conferences. Submissions that do not conform to the required styles, including paper size, margin width, and font size restrictions, will be rejected without review.

### Optional Supplementary Materials: Appendices, Software and Data

Each EMNLP-IJCNLP 2019 submission can be accompanied by a single PDF appendix, one .tgz or .zip archive containing software, and one .tgz or .zip archive containing data. EMNLP-IJCNLP 2019 encourages the submission of these supplementary materials to improve the reproducibility of results, and to enable authors to provide additional information that does not fit in the paper. For example, preprocessing decisions, model parameters, feature templates, lengthy proofs or derivations, pseudocode, sample system inputs/outputs, and other details that are necessary for the exact replication of the work described in the paper can be put into the appendix. However, the paper submissions need to remain fully self-contained, as these supplementary materials are completely optional, and reviewers are not even asked to review or download them. If the pseudo-code or derivations or model specifications are an important part of the contribution, or if they are important for the reviewers to assess the technical correctness of the work, they should be a part of the main paper, and not appear in the appendix. Supplementary materials need to be fully anonymized to preserve the double-blind reviewing policy.


## Presentation Requirement

All accepted papers must be presented at the conference in order to appear in the proceedings. At least one author of each accepted paper must register for EMNLP-IJCNLP 2019. Accepted papers will be presented orally or as a poster (at the discretion of the program chairs based on the nature rather than the quality of the work). There will be no distinction in the proceedings between papers presented orally or as posters.


## Further information

The conference website will continue to be updated with information on workshops, tutorials, the conference venue, traveling, etc.
