## Submission Information
We will be accepting submissions online via [START](https://www.softconf.com/emnlp2018/papers/).  The submission deadline for both long and short papers is May 22, 2018.

EMNLP uses a double-blind review process. Each submission will be reviewed by at least three program committee members. The review criteria are described in the [EMNLP 2018 Review Form Commentary](/reviewform).

### Long papers
EMNLP 2018 long paper submissions must describe substantial, original, completed and unpublished work. Wherever appropriate, concrete evaluation and analysis should be included. Each submission will be reviewed by at least three program committee members. Each long paper submission consists of a paper of up to eight (8) pages of content, plus unlimited pages for references; final versions of long papers will be given one additional page (up to nine pages with unlimited pages for references) so that reviewers' comments can be taken into account.

### Short papers
EMNLP 2018 also solicits short papers. Short paper submissions must describe original and unpublished work. While a short paper is not a shortened long paper, the characteristics of short papers include: a small, focused contribution; work in progress; a negative result; an opinion piece; an interesting application nugget. Each short paper submission consists of up to four (4) pages of content, plus unlimited pages for references; final versions of short papers will be given one additional page (up to five pages in the proceedings and unlimited pages for references) so that reviewers' comments can be taken into account. Each short paper submission will be reviewed by at least three program committee members.

### IMPORTANT: Anonymity Period
EMNLP 2018 adopts ACL's [new policies for submission, review, and citation](https://www.aclweb.org/portal/content/new-policies-submission-review-and-citation). Submissions that violate any of these policies will be rejected without review. 

Most importantly, the policies define an anonymity period, which starts on April 22nd, 2018 (11:59pm PDT).

- You may not make a non-anonymized version of your paper available to the general community (for example, by posting it on your home page or submitting it to arXiv) during the anonymity period. However, you may take such an action before the anonymity period begins, even if the paper actually becomes public after the anonymity period begins (for example, because arXiv makes papers public one or two days after receiving them).

-  You may not update a non-anonymized version during the anonymity period, and we ask you not to advertise it on social media or take other actions that would further compromise double-blind reviewing during the anonymity period.

-  You may make an anonymized version of your paper available, even during the anonymity period (for example, on [OpenReview](https://openreview.net/group?id=OpenReview.net/Anonymous_Preprint)).

- During the anonymity period, you may not update a non-anonymized version, advertise an anonymized or non-anonymized version on social media, or take any other action that would compromise double-blind reviewing during the anonymity period.

For the background of the new policies, refer to the [online version](https://www.aclweb.org/portal/content/new-policies-submission-review-and-citation).

### Instructions for Double-Blind Review

To ensure anonymity, submissions and supplementary materials must not include the authors' names and affiliations. Furthermore, self-references that reveal the author's identity, e.g., "We previously showed (Smith, 1991) ...", should be avoided. Instead, use citations such as "Smith (1991) previously showed ...". Acknowledgments of funding or assistance must also be omitted. Submissions should not contain pointers to supplemental information on the web; any such material should be submitted as supplementary materials (see above). Submissions that do not conform to these requirements will be rejected without review. Separate author identification information is required as part of the online submission process.

### Multiple Submission Policy
Papers that have been or will be submitted to other meetings or publications must indicate this at submission time, and must be withdrawn from the other venues if accepted by EMNLP 2018. We will not accept for publication or presentation papers that overlap significantly in content or results with papers that will be (or have been) published elsewhere. Authors submitting more than one paper to EMNLP 2018 must ensure that the submissions do not overlap significantly (>25%) with each other in content or results.

### Formatting Requirements
Both long and short papers must follow the EMNLP 2018 two-column format, using the [LaTeX style files](/downloads/emnlp18-latex.zip) or [Word template](/downloads/emnlp18-word.zip). Please do not modify these style files, or use templates designed for other conferences. Submissions that do not conform to the required styles, including paper size, margin width, and font size restrictions, will be rejected without review.

### Optional Supplementary Materials: Appendices, Software and Data
Each EMNLP 2018 submission can be accompanied by a single PDF appendix, one `.tgz` or `.zip` archive containing software, and one `.tgz` or `.zip` archive containing data. EMNLP 2018 encourages the submission of these supplementary materials to improve the reproducibility of results, and to enable authors to provide additional information that does not fit in the paper. For example, preprocessing decisions, model parameters, feature templates, lengthy proofs or derivations, pseudocode, sample system inputs/outputs, and other details that are necessary for the exact replication of the work described in the paper can be put into the appendix. However, the paper submissions need to remain fully self-contained, as these supplementary materials are completely optional, and reviewers are not even asked to review or download them. If the pseudo-code or derivations or model specifications are an important part of the contribution, or if they are important for the reviewers to assess the technical correctness of the work, they should be a part of the main paper, and not appear in the appendix. Supplementary materials need to be fully anonymized to preserve the double-blind reviewing policy.

## Presentation Requirement
All accepted papers must be presented at the conference in order to appear in the proceedings. At least one author of each accepted paper must register for EMNLP 2018. Accepted papers will be presented orally or as a poster (at the discretion of the program chairs based on the nature rather than the quality of the work). There will be no distinction in the proceedings between papers presented orally or as posters.

## Further information
The conference will be preceded by two days of workshops and tutorials (October 31 &ndash; November 1, 2018). This website will continue to be updated with information on workshops, tutorials, the conference venue, traveling, etc.
