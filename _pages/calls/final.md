The following instructions for the camera-ready versions of accepted submissions are adapted from ACL 2019.



## When and where do I submit my final camera-ready paper?

The deadline for camera-ready submission is August 30, 2019 (at 11:59pm, UTC-7 hours). You may submit the final version of your paper by navigating to the [EMNLP-IJCNLP 2019 START login](https://www.softconf.com/emnlp2019/papers) and following the internal links.



## How do I know my final submission is successful?

After submitting the final version of your paper, you can download the latest version of your paper and any supplemental material you have submitted upon logging into the START system. You can then check whether the version in the system is the correct version. 


## How should the final copy differ from the original submission?

The camera-ready version of your paper should incorporate the comments of the reviewers as well as other changes you see fit to make. In addition, be sure to do all of the following:

- Ensure that your paper conforms to the [provided styles, font and page size](https://www.emnlp-ijcnlp2019.org/calls/papers).
- Include the authors' names and affiliations under the title. Note that the list of authors should be identical to the list specified when submitting the paper.
- De-anonymize references to your own work in the body of the paper.
- Where appropriate, add acknowledgments for colleagues, reviewers, and grants. Please note that the acknowledgment section should fit within the allowed page boundaries (9 pages of content for long papers, 5 pages of content for short papers) and be in the same font as the rest of the paper.
- Ensure that all tables, graphs, and figures are readable at standard resolutions.
- If you have supplemental material (including written material, data, and/or code) ensure that all the components are put at the right place (more on that below).



## Where does the supplemental material go?

Supplemental material should be placed into a single .zip file with a maximum size of 10MB. You can include a single PDF file of appendices and non-readable supplemental material such as data and software inside the .zip file. For appendices, please format them using the same EMNLP-IJCNLP 2019 style files.


## How long can it be?

Long papers are permitted at most 9 pages of text while short papers may use up to 5 pages of text. Please use the extra space to help address reviewer comments. For both long and short papers, there is no page limit for references or appendices.



## What is the format for the camera-ready copy?

The file must be in Portable Document Format (PDF) on <b>A4 paper</b>. We require the use of [LaTeX style files or Microsoft Word Style files tailored for EMNLP-IJCNLP 2019](https://www.emnlp-ijcnlp2019.org/calls/papers). You can view the style files and detailed formatting instructions on the web.

If you are using LaTeX, please create the PDF file with pdflatex or xelatex. This ensures use of the proper Type 1 fonts and also takes advantage of other PDF features. You will have the best results using a modern LaTeX distribution, in particular, [TeX live](http://www.tug.org/texlive/). Using the geometry package to set the A4 format is recommended.



## What if my paper includes graphics?

Remember that you are providing a camera-ready copy. Thus, artwork and photos should be included directly in the paper in their final positions. Ideally, you should use vector graphic formats (PDF, EPS), which allow the graphics to scale arbitrarily. Avoid GIF or JPEG images that are low resolution or highly compressed.

Your paper must look good both when printed (A4 size) and when viewed on screen as PDF (zoomable to any size, color okay). Thus, you may want to use color high-resolution graphics, allowing readers to zoom in on a graph and study it. However, please check that the same graph or photograph is legible when printed and in a PDF viewer at different resolutions.
Don't go overboard on resolution; keep file sizes manageable. Note that vector graphics (e.g., encapsulated PostScript) look good at any scale and take up little space (unless you are plotting many thousands of data points).



## What about copyright?

When you submit the paper, you will be asked to sign the ACL Copyright Transfer Agreement on behalf of all authors electronically (via the [START Conference Manager](https://www.softconf.com/emnlp2019/papers/)). Authors retain many rights under this agreement and it is appropriate in the vast majority of cases. Please contact the publication chairs Fei Liu and Pontus Stenetorp with any concerns regarding copyright.

Before signing this form, please confirm with your co-authors (and, if applicable, your and their employers) that they authorize you to sign on their behalf.


## What if my paper's title or other metadata has changed?

Please note that your name will appear in conference metadata as you have configured it in START, so make sure that it is correct there (e.g., capitalization, full name, etc). You can change this on the user settings page of the START conference manager, under "User" > "Account Information" > "Update Profile". You can change the title of the paper on the camera-ready submission site. If you have questions regarding change of other information, please contact the program co-chairs at <a href="mailto:emnlp-ijcnlp-2019-program-chairs@googlegroups.com">emnlp-ijcnlp-2019-program-chairs@googlegroups.com</a>.
