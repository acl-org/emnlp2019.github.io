## Updates on Conference Organization

<b>October 19, 2019</b>

We are delighted to let you know that over 1,700 people have registered for the conference. This is already the largest IJCNLP ever and one of the largest EMNLP's ever. We look forward to welcoming you at the venue!

For your convenience and to avoid any issues with affected areas during the conference, we have made the following special arrangements:

1. Apps by the Hong Kong government reporting the latest situation and by the MTR (i.e., the public train service) giving up-to-date train schedules will be made available for download.
2. We have assigned a local information officer to update the conference website with the latest information about the city.
3. We still have some guestrooms available in the hotels in Kwai Chung, Tsing Yi and Tsuen Wan.  Please note that they do go fast and participants are advised to [book](https://www.emnlp-ijcnlp2019.org/participants/hotels/) ASAP.
4. We provide free circular shuttle service between the Airport Regal Hotel and AWE (the conference venue).
5. We provide return shuttle bus service between hotels in Kwai Chung, Tsing Yi, and Tsuen Wan to AWE everyday. The schedule will be announced shortly. Please note that participants must book their shuttle in advance (HKD100 per day) via our [hotel page](https://www.emnlp-ijcnlp2019.org/participants/hotels/) or directly [here](https://mice.ctshkvip.com/transfer-booking/).
6. We provide free shuttle service for the social event on the evening of November 6, 2019:

   - From AWE to Hong Kong Disneyland (HKDL). Student helpers will hold up boards to guide participants to the shuttle at the end of the Conference day.
   - After the event, there are two routes of shuttle bus services: (a) HKDL -> Airport -> SkyCity Marriot Hotel; (b) HKDL -> Hotels in Kwai Chung, Tsuan Wan, and Tsing Yi.
   
7. There are many food service establishments at the airport, but their access is normally restricted to travelers with valid flight tickets. We have obtained permission from the authority for free access to the airport by EMNLP-IJCNLP 2019 participants simply by presenting their conference pass.

We hope you will have a pleasant stay in Hong Kong! 


<b>October 9, 2019</b>

Regarding recent events in Hong Kong, we would like to update prospective attendees with information regarding safety and transportation. We are committed to the conference proceeding as planned, in what we expect to be the stability and broad safety of the conference venue area and Lantau Island more generally, and the conference has (like many registrants) non-refundable commitments to the conference proceeding as planned. 

While we recognize that there may be periodic local disruptions in the central area, most of Hong Kong proceed with their work and normal lives, and in the many months of protests so far, tourists have consistently remained safe and except for a few hours over 4 months, the airport (and conference venue area) has proceeded on a normal schedule. If in the unlikely event of significant public transportation disruptions, we plan to arrange conference-dedicated bus transport from key hotel areas in both Kowloon and the major Lantau Island hotels, and several of these remain within easy walking distance, and our exciting social event at Hong Kong Disneyland is quite close to the conference venue. In addition, taxis and car-sharing services (e.g., Uber) remain readily available as usual. Many thousands of flights a week from around the world continue to arrive in Hong Kong on their normal schedule. 

We will actively keep prospective attendees updated regarding security measures, transportation, food, etc.


<b>August 23, 2019</b>

The conference organizing committee has been working hard to welcome you on Nov 3&ndash;7 in Hong Kong. We fully expect EMNLP-IJCNLP 2019 will proceed as planned.

- HK International Airport has been back to normal operation for some time;
- The conference venue, Asia World Expo (AWE), is near the airport. AWE, as well as Disneyland, the social event venue, are both located on Lantau Island. They're remote from currently affected areas in Hong Kong Island, Kowloon, and the New Territories; 
- Information on accommodation near the conference venue will be provided;
- We're continuously observing the local situation and will keep you up-to-date on this website.
