## Update on Conference Organization

(August 23, 2019)

The conference organizing committee has been working hard to welcome you on Nov 3&ndash;7 in Hong Kong. We fully expect EMNLP-IJCNLP 2019 will proceed as planned.

- HK International Airport has been back to normal operation for some time;
- The conference venue, Asia World Expo (AWE), is near the airport. AWE, as well as Disneyland, the social event venue, are both located on Lantau Island. They're remote from currently affected areas in Hong Kong Island, Kowloon, and the New Territories; 
- Information on accommodation near the conference venue will be provided;
- We're continuously observing the local situation and will keep you up-to-date on this website. 



## Visa Information

Since visa applications can take almost two months or more to be approved, we advise that you apply as soon as possible. If you require an invitation letter for your visa application, please send an [email to the Local Organizing Secretariat](mailto:emnlp-ijcnlp-2019-local-organizing-committee@googlegroups.com?subject=EMNNLP-IJCNLP 2019: Letter of Invitation and Visa) with the following information and a copy of your passport:

- Your full name as it appears in your passport
- Your work address
- The name(s) of any accepted papers
- The email address of the embassy that will handle your request

It is understood that such an invitation is intended to help delegates to raise funds to obtain a visa and does not imply a commitment from the conference organizers to provide any financial support or scheduling of presentation.
