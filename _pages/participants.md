## About Brussels

Situated in the heart of Europe, the city of Brussels is an international, multicultural city with a rich historical past. Brussels is the home of various European institutions, and is known for its gastronomy, architectural heritage, and comic book heroes.

{% include gallery id="brussels" %}

Brussels is easy to reach by air, road and rail, but also easy to move around in. In this compact city, many places are within walking distance, or a short ride away by tram, bus or metro. And if you’re staying near the city centre, walking is a wonderful way to discover historical Brussels. More details about transportation to and within Brussels can be found on this [page](https://visit.brussels/en/article/Getting-to-Brussels).

## Instructions for Presenters

These instructions will be updated as more details become available.

### Oral Presentations

**Talk length:**
- Long papers will be given an 18 minute slot (15 minutes for the talk and 3 minutes for questions).
- Short papers will be given a 12 minute slot (10 minutes for the talk and 2 minutes for questions).

**Audiovisual equipment:** The projectors have HDMI connectors and a resolution of 1920 x 1080 pixels (16:9 aspect ratio). Please be sure to bring display adapters for your laptop, if necessary.

**Preparation:** Please be sure to arrive at your session during the preceding break (at least 15 minutes before the start of the session). Please introduce yourself to the session chair and the volunteers, who will help you to test your laptop with the projector.

**Video recording:** We have hired a professional videographer to record all of the oral presentations at EMNLP 2018.  We will make the videos available online after the conference.  Our goal is to improve the dissemination of the scientific materials that are generated for the conference.  To simplify the logistics, all talks will be recorded.  If you want to opt out before/after the conference, please send an email to emnlp2018-video-chair@googlegroups.com to have your talk removed from the archive.

### Posters

**Poster size:** Posters should be no wider than 91 cm (36 in) and no higher than 122 cm (48 in), in vertical/portrait orientation. A0 paper (in vertical/portrait orientation) meets these requirements. 

**Preparation:** Please arrive in Grand Hall 2 during the preceding break (at least 15 minutes before the start of the session) to find your poster's location and to mount your poster using the materials provided. Poster locations will be listed in a guide distributed to all participants, and volunteers will be available to assist you if needed.

**Cleanup:** Please remove your poster right after the poster session ends; do not leave your poster in the room.

## Social Event

On the evening of Saturday, November 3rd, the EMNLP 2018 social event will take place at the [Royal Museums of Fine Arts of Belgium](https://www.fine-arts-museum.be/en). Four museums, housed in a single building, will welcome the EMNLP delegates with their prestigious collection of 20,000 works of art. The Museums’ collections trace the history of the visual arts &mdash; painting, sculpture and drawing &mdash; from the 15th to the 21st century.

## Childcare Grants

ACL 2017 and NAACL 2018 provided on-site daycare to participants attending the conference at a subsidized rate. However, it was under-utilized at those conferences.
