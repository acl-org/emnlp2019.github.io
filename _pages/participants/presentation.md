The following instructions are relevant to anyone presenting his or her work orally or as a poster at the EMNLP-IJCNLP 2019 main conference, or who is planning to give a remote presentation.


## Oral Presentations

### Length 

The length of each long paper presentation will be 18 minutes, including 15 minutes for the talk and 3 minutes for Q&amp;A. 

The length of each short paper presentation will be 12 minutes, including 10 minutes for the talk and 2 minutes for Q&amp;A.

### Computer equipment

There will be a PC with the following configuration in each room: Dell E7440 &amp; E7450 (Intel i5-4310u up / 8GB / 256SSD / 14" / HDMI port / Acrobat Reader / Windows 10 / Microsoft Office 365). 

There will also be a wireless presentation clicker with laser pointer provided. 

### Slides

Please use standard aspect ratio (4:3) to prepare your presentation slides. Please use a USB stick to copy your slides to the conference PC in the room of your session 10 minutes before your session starts. 

Presenting from the conference PC is the default (and the strongly preferred) option. In case of real problems, you may present from your own laptop, but please bring along any adapters needed to connect to HDMI if you need to use this option.

### Set-up and Preparation

Please be sure to arrive at your session during the preceding break (at least 10 minutes before the start of the session) and introduce yourself to the session chair. Make sure to briefly test your slides on the conference PC. 

In order to speed transitions, please set up your presentation file (or connect your computer) while the previous speaker is finishing answering questions, so that your presentation is ready to start on time.



## Poster Presentations 

### Poster Size

Posters should be no wider than 100cm (39 in) and no higher than 250cm (98 in). A0 paper in portrait orientation meets the requirements.

### Poster Printing

Please note that the conference does not provide any poster printer. There may not be any poster printing shop near the conference site, either. You are strongly recommended to print your poster before coming to the conference. Please approach the registration desk, should you need any help with poster printing.

### Set-up and Preparation

Please arrive during the preceding break (at least 10 minutes before the start of the session) to find your poster's location and to mount your poster.

### Cleanup

Please remove your poster right after the poster session ends. Do not leave your poster in the room, as the space will be needed for posters in the next session.



## Demo Presentations
 
Each demo station includes the following:
- A table and a chair
- A poster board of 100 cm (width) x 250 cm (height)
- A monitor (Viewsonic 23" full HD widescreen LED monitor)
- One HDMI cable to connect a laptop to the monitor and two backup VGA cables. (No adaptors are provided.)
- One Hong Kong socket
 
The demo stations will be numbered. There will be student volunteers there to help.
 
When the demo session stops, presenters are asked to remove their posters and their material from the table.



## Remote Presentations

EMNLP-IJCNLP 2019 will be accepting applications for remote presentations in circumstances where none of the authors can attend the conference due to reasons such as:

- illness, disability, or any other reason that physically prevent attending,
- visa issues or government travel restrictions that legally prevent attending,
- special circumstances such as death in immediate family.

Please contact the remote presentation chair to apply for remote presentation at ([emnlp-ijcnlp-2019-remote-presentation@googlegroups.com](mailto:emnlp-ijcnlp-2019-remote-presentation@googlegroups.com)), as per the following application procedure:

1. Register for the conference normally.
2. Send your application for remote presentation to the remote presentation chair at ([emnlp-ijcnlp-2019-remote-presentation@googlegroups.com](mailto:emnlp-ijcnlp-2019-remote-presentation@googlegroups.com)). Please include a detailed explanation of why you are unable to attend the conference.
3. Upon acceptance of your request, please follow the additional instructions you will be provided with.

Each request will be carefully considered on a case-by-case basis by the remote presentation chair. Please refrain from requesting remote presenting for personal reasons or for reasons regarding the demonstrations in Hong Kong. Please be assured that the conference venue, social event venue, and accommodation are all remote from affected areas.

There are circumstances where remote presentation is the only possibility, and we strongly believe these should be accommodated out of fairness and inclusivity. However, excessive remote presentations change the character of the conference, and we wish to provide a positive experience for the conference attendees. We kindly ask for your understanding in case your request for remote presentation is rejected.
