The following instructions are relevant to anyone presenting his or her work orally or as a poster at the EMNLP-IJCNLP 2019 main conference.


## Oral Presentations

### Length 

The length of each long paper presentation will be 18 minutes, including 15 minutes for the talk and 3 minutes for Q&amp;A. 

The length of each short paper presentation will be 12 minutes, including 10 minutes for the talk and 2 minutes for Q&amp;A.

### Computer equipment

There will be a PC with the following configuration in each room: Dell E7440 &amp; E7450 (Intel i5-4310u up / 8GB / 256SSD / 14" / HDMI port / Acrobat Reader / Windows 10 / Microsoft Office 365). 

There will also be a wireless presentation clicker with laser pointer provided. 

### Slides

Please use standard aspect ratio (4:3) to prepare your presentation slides. Please use a USB stick to copy your slides to the conference PC in the room of your session 10 minutes before your session starts. 

Presenting from the conference PC is the default (and the strongly preferred) option. In case of real problems, you may present from your own laptop, but please bring along any adapters needed to connect to HDMI if you need to use this option.

### Set-up and Preparation

Please be sure to arrive at your session during the preceding break (at least 10 minutes before the start of the session) and introduce yourself to the session chair. Make sure to briefly test your slides on the conference PC. 

In order to speed transitions, please set up your presentation file (or connect your computer) while the previous speaker is finishing answering questions, so that your presentation is ready to start on time.



## Poster Presentations 

### Poster size

Posters should be no wider than 100cm (39 in) and no higher than 250cm (98 in). A0 paper in portrait orientation meets the requirements.

### Poster printing

Please note that the conference does not provide any poster printer. There may not be any poster printing shop near the conference site, either. You are strongly recommended to print your poster before coming to the conference. Please approach the registration desk, should you need any help with poster printing.

### Set-up and preparation

Please arrive during the preceding break (at least 10 minutes before the start of the session) to find your poster's location and to mount your poster.

### Cleanup

Please remove your poster right after the poster session ends. Do not leave your poster in the room, as the space will be needed for posters in the next session.
