## October 31 &amp; November 1

### \[W1\] WMT18
[The Third Conference on Machine Translation](http://www.statmt.org/wmt18/) conference builds on a series of annual workshops and conferences on statistical machine translation, going back to 2006.

### \[W2\] CoNLL 
[The Conference on Computational Natural Language Learning](http://www.conll.org) is a top-tier conference, yearly organized by SIGNLL (ACL's Special Interest Group on Natural Language Learning).  

## October 31

### \[W3\] LOUHI
[The Ninth International Workshop on Health Text Mining and Information Analysis](https://louhi2018.fbk.eu) provides an interdisciplinary forum for researchers interested in automated processing of health documents.

### \[W4\] ALW2
The last few years have seen a surge in abusive online behavior, with governments, social media platforms, and individuals struggling to cope with the consequences and to produce effective methods to combat it. The [Second Workshop on Abusive Language Online](https://sites.google.com/view/alw2018) bring researchers of various disciplines together to discuss approaches to abusive language. 

### \[W5\] SCAI
The [Search-Oriented Conversational AI](http://scai.info) workshop aims to bring together AI/Deep Learning specialists on one hand and search/IR specialists on the other hand to lay the ground for search-oriented conversational AI and establish future directions and collaborations.

### \[W6\] SIGMORPHON 
The [Fifteenth Workshop on Computational Research in Phonetics, Phonology, and Morphology](https://sigmorphon.github.io) organized by the ACL Special Interest Group on Computational Morphology and Phonology provides a forum for exchanging news of recent research developments and other matters of interest in computational morphology and phonology.

### \[W7\] WASSA
The aim of the [9th Workshop on Computational Approaches to Subjectivity, Sentiment and Social Media Analysis](https://wt-public.emm4u.eu/wassa2018/) is to continue the line of the previous editions, bringing together researchers in Computational Linguistics working on Subjectivity and Sentiment Analysis and researchers working on interdisciplinary aspects of affect computation from text.

### \[W8\] SMM4H
The [3rd Workshop on Social Media Mining for Health Applications Workshop & Shared Task](https://healthlanguageprocessing.org/smm4h/) seeks to attract researchers interested in automatic methods for the collection, extraction, representation, analysis, and validation of social media data for health informatics. It serves as a unique forum to discuss novel approaches to text and data mining methods that are applicable to social media data and may prove invaluable for health monitoring and surveillance.

## November 1

### \[W9\] BioASQ
The aim of [Large-scale Biomedical Semantic Indexing and Question Answering](http://bioasq.org/workshop) workshop is to push the research frontier towards systems that use the diverse and voluminous information available online to respond directly to the information needs of biomedical scientists.

### \[W10\] BlackboxNLP
The goal of the [Analyzing and Interpreting Neural Networks for NLP](https://blackboxnlp.github.io) workshop is to bring together people who are attempting to peek inside the neural network black box, taking inspiration from machine learning, psychology, linguistics and neuroscience. 

### \[W11\] FEVER
The [First Workshop on Fact Extraction and VERification](http://fever.ai) brings together researchers working on various tasks related to fact extraction and verification and also hosts the FEVER Challenge, an information verification shared task.

### \[W12\] ARGMINING
The goal of the [5th International Workshop on Argument Mining](https://www.research.ibm.com/haifa/Workshops/argmining17/) is to provide a continuing forum to the last four yearsâ€™ Argumentation Mining workshops at ACL and NAACL, the first research forum devoted to argumentation mining in all domains of discourse.

### \[W13\] W-NUT
The [4th Workshop on Noisy User-generated Text](https://noisy-text.github.io/2018/index.html) focuses on Natural Language Processing applied to noisy user-generated text, such as that found in social media, online reviews, crowdsourced data, web forums, clinical records and language learner essays. 

### \[W14\] UDW-18
The [Second Workshop on Universal Dependencies](http://universaldependencies.org/udw18/) invites papers on all topics relevant to universal dependencies. Priority will be given to papers that adopt a cross-lingual perspective.
