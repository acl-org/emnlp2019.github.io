### \[W1\] W-NUT 2019
[The 5th Workshop on Noisy User-generated Text](http://noisy-text.github.io/) 
focuses on Natural Language Processing applied to noisy user-generated text, such as that found in social media, online reviews, crowdsourced data, web forums, clinical records and language learner essays.

### \[W2\] WNGT
[The 3rd Workshop on Neural Generation and Translation](https://sites.google.com/view/wngt18/home) 
aims to provide a forum for research in applications of neural models to language generation and translation tasks.

### \[W3\] CoNLL 2019 
[The Conference on Computational Natural Language Learning](http://www.conll.org) 
is a top-tier conference, yearly organized by SIGNLL (ACL's Special Interest Group on Natural Language Learning).

### \[W4\] WAT2019
[The 6th Workshop on Asian Translation](http://lotus.kuee.kyoto-u.ac.jp/WAT/) 
is a new open evaluation campaign focusing on Asian languages.

### \[W5\] NLP4IF
[NLP for Freedom: Censorship, Disinformation, and Propaganda](http://netsci.montclair.edu/nlp4if/) 
is a workshop dedicated to NLP methods that potentially contribute (either positively or negatively) to the free flow of information on the Internet, or to our understanding of the issues that arise in this area.

### \[W6\] DeepLo 2019
[Deep Learning for Low-Resource Natural Language Processing](https://sites.google.com/view/deeplo19/) 
is a workshop that will bring together experts in deep learning and natural language processing whose research focuses on learning with scarce data.

### \[W7\] FEVER
[The second workshop on Fact Extraction and VERification](http://fever.ai) 
brings together researchers working on various tasks related to fact extraction and verification and also hosts the FEVER Challenge, an information verification shared task.

### \[W8\] TextGraphs-19
[Graph-based Methods for Natural Language Processing](https://sites.google.com/view/textgraphs2019) 
is a workshop series that publishes and promotes the synergy between the field of Graph Theory and Natural Language Processing.

### \[W9\] LOUHI 2019
[The Tenth International Workshop on Health Text Mining and Information Analysis](http://louhi2019.fbk.eu/) 
provides an interdisciplinary forum for researchers interested in automated processing of health documents.

### \[W10\] COIN
[COmmonsense INference in NLP](http://www.coli.uni-saarland.de/~mroth/COIN/) 
is a workshop that aims at bringing together researchers that are interested in modeling commonsense knowledge, developing computational models thereof, and applying commonsense inference methods in NLP tasks.

### \[W11\] 
[The Workshop on New Frontiers in Summarization](https://summarization2019.github.io/) 
seeks to bring together researchers from a diverse range of fields (e.g., summarization, visualization, language generation, cognitive and psycholinguistics) for discussion on key issues related to automatic summarization.

### \[W12\] ECONLP 2019
[The 2nd Workshop on Economics and Natural Language Processing](https://julielab.de/econlp/2019) 
addresses the increasing relevance of natural language processing (NLP) for regional, national and international economy, both in terms of already operational language technology products and systems, as well as newly emerging methodologies and techniques reflecting the requirements at the intersection of economics and NLP. 

### \[W13\] AnnoNLP
[Aggregating and analysing crowdsourced annotations for NLP](http://dali.eecs.qmul.ac.uk/annonlp) 
Although there is a large body of work analysing crowdsourced data, be that probabilistic or traditional, there has been less work devoted to NLP tasks. The aim of the proposed workshop is to bring together the community of researchers interested in this area.

### \[W14\] DiscoMT19
[Discourse in Machine Translation 2019](https://www.idiap.ch/workshop/DiscoMT) 
focuses on language processing techniques, whether theoretically-inspired or empirical, which address one or more discourse-level phenomena in combination with MT or from a cross-lingual perspective.

### \[W15\] LANTERN
[Beyond Vision and Language: Integrating Knowledge from the Real World](https://www.lantern.uni-saarland.de/) 
aims to to bring together researchers from different disciplines but united by their adoption of techniques from machine learning, neuroscience, multi-agents, natural language processing, computer vision and psychology to interconnect language and vision by leveraging external knowledge provided by either fixed or environments.

### \[W16\] MRQA
[The 2nd Workshop on Machine Reading for Question Answering](https://mrqa.github.io/) 
focuses on understanding and improving methods for question answering (QA) from the text. This year, the workshop will host a shared task on QA with an emphasis on generalization.

### \[W17\] MSR 2019
[The second Workshop on Multilingual Surface Realization](http://taln.upf.edu/pages/msr2019-ws/) 
aims at bringing together people who are interested in surface-oriented Natural Language Generation problems such as word order determination, inflection, functional word determination, paraphrasing, etc.

### \[W18\] BioNLP-OST 2019
[International Workshop on BioNLP Open Shared Tasks 2019](http://2019.bionlp-ost.org) 
is organized to facilitate development and sharing of computational tasks of biomedical text mining and solutions to them.
